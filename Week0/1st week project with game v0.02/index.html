                  Yoko Taro was born in Nagoya, Aichi, on June 6, 1970.
    Taro's parents were often absent from home due to their jobs, so he was mostly raised by his grandmother, who left a strong impression on him. During his youth, he heard about an incident that would influence his later work as a scenario writer: while an acquaintance was in a shopping street with a group of friends, one of them who was walking along a high building roof slipped and died from the fall.
    He studied at Kobe Design University and graduated in March 1994. He is married to Yukiko Yoko, an illustrator who worked on Taiko no Tatsujin series and also did work on Drakengard 3 (a project where Yoko-san was creative director, scenario writer).

      <h2>His p[A]th</h2>
  <p><section class="container">Initially Yoko Taro not intending to pursue a career in video games, his first job a month after graduating was as a 3D CGI designer for Namco. In 1999, he joined Sugar & Rockets Inc., a now-defunct in-house developer owned by Sony Computer Entertainment. In 2001, a year after Sugar & Rockets' consolidation by Sony, Yoko got a job at the now-defunct games company Caviar. Starting his career there, he immediately became known as an eccentric person. At that moment Cavia studio worked on Drakengard. game's co-producer Takuya Iwasaki intended to take the director's role, he was busy with other projects, so Yoko was asked to take up director's duties. He also helped create the scenario and characters, as well as co-writing the script with Sawako Natori. <br><br>
  
  The script of Drakengard was literately the quintessence of post modernism. Insane plot-twists, and creepy atmosphere they plunged the player into a state of infernal madness. In other words, Taro had a lot of fun tearing up the standards of screenwriting, along with ethical norms. 
  
  During its production, Yoko was unhappy with the amount of changes asked for by the game's advisory board. It got to the point where he decided he would not work on another Drakengard. 
  
    He was later involved in the production of Drakengard 2, being credited as a video editor while also remaining as one of the game's creative staff. Mostly tied up with another project during production, his original concept for the game as an arcade-style game with dragons in space was vetoed and he had creative clashes with the game's new director Akira Yasui. <br><br>
  
  After Drakengard 2 was completed, Yoko started work on a third entry in the series. As the game developed, the initial concept was developed to the point where the game was rebranded as Nier, a spin-off from the series. Yoko Taro contacted his friend, with whom they studied at the university together, by a happy coincidence, this friend turned out to be the most talented composer in Japan, Keiichi Okabe. Together they started working on a new project - Nier. <br><br>

               Keiichi Okabe is a Japanese composer and arranger, best known for composing music for the Tekken and Drakengard series.He started his career at Namco in 1994, where he primarily composed for arcade games. Outside of video games, he has composed for anime series such as Working!! and Yuki Yuna is a Hero, along with arranging tracks for J-pop artists. He established the music production studio Monaca in 2004, which composes for various types of media. <br> <br>
                  <strong>Interesting fact:</strong> Keiichi Okabe wrote the music for the game Nier without seeing a single frame from the game. He wrote the soundtracks simply based on a script from Yoko Taro.

    The vocalist for the soundtracks of all Nier series games was the British singer Emy Evans, who later became the real voice of the Nier gaming universe. Sales of the Nier:Replicant were not very good, however critics have noted Yoko's unconventional game design and writing style. One of the main aspects of his work is exploring the darker aspects of people, such as why they are driven to kill each other, although he typically does not share a common opinion on his story's dark natures. His writing technique, described as "backwards scriptwriting", involves outlining the ending of the story first and building the narrative backward from that point. Nier is very different from the first project of Yoko Taro, instead of hopeless darkness and cruelty, the main idea of the game was the idea of self-sacrifice for the sake of loved ones. And the atmosphere of the game turned from infernally scary to gently melancholic (largely due to the masterpiece music).
    After Nier was released and Cavia was absorbed into AQ Interactive, Yoko left the company and pursued an independent career. <br><br>
    
  During this period, he took an unknown role in the development of Square Enix's social game Monster × Dragon. The majority of his freelance work involved social mobile games. Many years later, Yoko teamed back up with multiple staff from the production of Drakengard and Nier to create a true second sequel to Drakengard, determining through questionnaires that the main appeal to the fanbase was the dark stories. After the completion of Drakengard 3, Yoko "went back into unemployment" <br><br>
  
  Meanwhile, to the surprise of Yoko Taro a real miracle happened: gradually, the Nier:Replicant game formed an active and loyal fan base, which on the one hand tried to promote the game by talking about it on reddit, on the other hand they began to persuade Yoko Taro to make a sequel. 
  Yoko Taro contacted Platinum Games Studio, the creators of the Bayonetta series of games. At that time, Platinum Games had just finished work on Bayonetta 2, so the publisher Square Enix decided to give Yoko Taro a chance, especially since unexpectedly for him many Platinum Games employees were fans of Nier:Replicant. The studio's vast experience in creating action games, great in directing and screenwriting of Yoko Taro, together with the creative genius of composer Keiichi Okabe and his studio Monaka, made their job.  The release of Nier:Automata on March 17th, 2017 was the most successful release by Platinum games studio, and Yoko Taro in particular. <br><br>

                  Project Nier: Automata became successful even before the release, when after the release of the demo, the whole world was amazed by the beauty of the main character of the game - an android named 2B (YoRHa model: 2 type: B, to be precise). <br><br>
                  <strong>Interesting fact:</strong> In the Western public, scandals a race around Nier:Automata, due to the excessive sexualization of the main characters of the game. In response, Yoko Taro officially stated that he wants people to send him by e-mail all the erotic content with the main character of the game - 2B, which they can only find.

    Square Enix, who did not expect such success, immediately began organizing concerts around the world (I will tell you about this later in the chapter about concerts), and they also began organizing interviews for Yoko Taro, with whom they had a very strained relationship due to the fact that Taro was systematically late for work, and always delayed production games with because his irresponsibility and eccentricity.  (he literally had to be forced to work).
    
    Yoko has stated his intense dislike of interviews. His reason, according to his Famitsu column, was that he feels video game developers are not entertainers or commentators on their work and that he thinks the subjects they talk about in interviews would be overly boring to those reading or listening. When he does give interviews, he prefers to wear a <strong>mask</strong> to avoid being photographed, and in a video interview concerning Drakengard 3, he used a glove puppet. He has also stated that he likes to be blunt when stating his opinions, as he feels that video game fans deserve truth and honesty. With his honest statements and funny antics, Taro has found popularity and the love of fans. <br>
    
    
    
    Currently Yoko Taro  is busy writing the script for the next installment of the Nier series of games - mobile game Nier:Reincarnation. As well as writing theatrical productions based on the game, and organizing concerts.

                <span class="black-text">All games from Yoko Taro are characterized by amazing music, which is often part of the plot. That's why it's worth talking about music separately.
      This is especially true for the Nier series of games. After all, there musicals are part of the plot and hidden lore
      The works of Yoko Taro have made a great contribution to modern art, largely due to the magnificent music. And in order to allow people to enjoy this music live, Square Enix organizes concerts.
                 Emy Evans is the main voice of the Nier series. She is the vocalist in all the compositions. Sings in the language of chaos (a fictional language specifically for a series of games) She wrote some of the songs personally.
